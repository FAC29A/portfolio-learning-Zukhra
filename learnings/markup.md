# Markup
This topic is focused on the fundamental building blocks of web pagesâ€”accessible, semantic HTML, and well-organised CSS.

## Git workflow

1. **Creating a New Repository:**
   - Setting up a new GitHub repository where your project code will be hosted.
     
2. **Clone this new repository using your terminal:**
   ```
   git clone 'PASTE THE URL OF YOUR REPOSITORY HERE'
   ```

2. **Issue Tracking:**
   - Using GitHub issues to track tasks and features to be implemented in the project.

3. **Branching:**
   - Creating separate branches for different features or tasks to ensure isolated development.
     ```
     git branch branch-name
     ```
   - Leave the main branch by switching to the new branch you have just created.
     ```
     git checkout branch-name
     ```
     Alternatively you can do this in a single step by using the -b flag to tell the git checkout command to create the new branch:
     ```
     git checkout -b branch-name
     ```   

4. **Committing Changes:**
   - Making changes to code files and committing them with descriptive commit messages.

5. **Pushing to Remote:**
   - Pushing your branch's changes to the remote GitHub repository.
     ```
     git push origin branch-name
     ```

6. **Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - Creating pull requests to propose changes to the **main** branch.
   - Reviewing PRs for code quality, correctness, and adherence to coding standards.

7. **Merging PRs:**
   - Merging approved pull requests into the main branch once they have been reviewed and approved.

8. **Handling Merge Conflicts:**
   - Resolving conflicts that occur when multiple branches modify the same code.

9. **Collaboration:**
   - Collaborating with team members by assigning tasks, reviewing code, and ensuring a smooth workflow.

11. **Best Practices:**
    - Following best practices for writing descriptive commit messages, linking commits to related issues, and maintaining a clean Git history.

## CSS layout

### Flow Layout

Flow layout is the default behavior of elements in CSS. It defines how block and inline elements are positioned within a document. Key points about flow layout:

- Block elements (e.g., div, header, p) take up the full width of the page.
- Inline elements (e.g., span, strong, a) occupy only as much horizontal space as needed.
- The viewport scrolls vertically when content overflows the screen.
- Content that is too wide for the viewport wraps elements onto the next line.

### Grid and Flexbox

CSS offers powerful layout tools in the form of grid and flexbox. These layouts provide greater control and flexibility in arranging elements. Key points:

- Grid layout allows you to create complex, grid-based designs.
- Flexbox is excellent for arranging elements in a single row or column.
- Both grid and flexbox layouts can adapt to different screen sizes.

### Centering Content

Centering content is a common layout task. You can achieve this using various techniques, such as:

- Setting `margin-left` and `margin-right` to `0` to constrain content width.
- Using `text-align: center` for centering inline elements.
- Applying flexbox or grid centering properties for more complex layouts.

### Using Variables and Root to Style CSS

CSS variables and the `:root` pseudo-class provide a convenient way to define and manage styles. Key points:

- Define CSS variables at the root level using `:root`.
- Access and utilize variables within your stylesheet to apply consistent styles.
- CSS variables make it easier to maintain and update styles.
```css
/* Define CSS variables at the :root level */
:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
  --font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}

/* Utilize the defined variables in your stylesheet */
body {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  font-family: var(--font-family);
}
```

### Managing Spacing with a Parent Element (Stack)

One of the fundamental aspects of layout design is controlling the spacing between elements. To enhance reusability and maintain simplicity, it's often a good practice to avoid applying spacing rules directly to individual elements.

 A more flexible approach is to create a parent element that manages the spacing for its children. This common pattern is often referred to as a "stack." While various layout techniques (such as flexbox or grid) can be used to implement stacks, I'll illustrate a simple approach using margins.

```css
/* Apply a top margin of 1rem to all elements inside .stack */
.stack > * {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}

/* Special handling for the first child element inside .stack */
.stack > *:first-child {
  margin-top: 0; /* Remove the top margin to avoid extra spacing above the first element */
}
```

## Semantic HTML

**Semantic HTML** is all about using the right HTML elements to convey the structure and meaning of your content, rather than just its appearance. It's essential for several reasons:

1. **Default Styles:** Browsers provide built-in styles for standard HTML elements. By using them, you save time and ensure your page still looks good even if your CSS fails.

2. **Complex Behavior:** Browsers handle intricate interactions like button clicks and keyboard actions. Relying on semantic elements saves you from reinventing the wheel.

3. **Machine-Readable:** Semantic HTML allows browsers and software to understand your content. It's critical for accessibility, ensuring that tools like screen readers can interpret your page correctly.

### Implementing Semantic HTML

To make your HTML more semantic:

- Use block elements like `<header>` and `<footer>` for meaningful page sections.
- Employ heading tags like `<h2>` and `<h3>` to structure your content.
- Utilize the `<a>` element for links to other pages.
- Choose `<button>` for elements triggering JavaScript behavior.
- Use `<form>` along with `<input>` and include `<label>` for user input forms.
- For layout or styling, you can use non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span`.

By following these guidelines, you create more accessible and meaningful web pages.

## Learn Accessibility

1. **Accessibility Matters**: Web accessibility ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use your websites. It's not just a good practice; it's a moral obligation for developers.

2. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume that all users will interact with your site in the same way. Consider a broad range of abilities and preferences when designing and developing your UI.

3. **Universal Design**: Strive to create user interfaces that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or limitations. A UI that's only usable by a specific group of users is considered broken.

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Extensive testing is crucial for identifying accessibility issues. Use various tools, including screen readers, keyboard navigation, and manual testing, to ensure your website is truly accessible.

5. **WCAG Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a comprehensive standard for web accessibility. Use tools like The A11y Project's Checklist to ensure you've covered the basics.

6. **Automated Tools**: While automated testing tools like Lighthouse (only for Chrome) can catch some issues, they can't identify all accessibility problems. Manual testing remains essential to uncover complex or nuanced accessibility challenges.
7. **Some of Accessibility Attributes and Tags**:

    - **aria-label**:
        - **Description**: The `aria-label` attribute provides an accessible name for an HTML element when the element's content doesn't convey its purpose. It's essential for elements like buttons or icons that lack text labels.
        - **Usage Example**: `<button aria-label="Close">X</button>`

    - **alt**:
        - **Description**: The `alt` attribute is used with the `<img>` element to offer alternative text for images. This alternative text is read aloud by screen readers, describing the image for visually impaired users.
        - **Usage Example**: `<img src="example.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the mountains">`

    - **tabindex**:
        - **Description**: The `tabindex` attribute defines the tab order for interactive elements on a webpage, determining the sequence in which users navigate using the keyboard's Tab key.
        - **Usage Example**: `<input type="text" tabindex="2">`

    - **role**:
        - **Description**: The `role` attribute defines the role or type of an element, aiding screen readers in understanding an element's purpose, especially when it doesn't have a native HTML role.
        - **Usage Example**: `<div role="alert">This is an alert message.</div>`
