## Git workflow

1. **Creating a New Repository:**
   - Setting up a new GitHub repository where your project code will be hosted.
     
2. **Clone this new repository using your terminal:**
   `git clone 'PASTE THE URL OF YOUR REPOSITORY HERE'`

2. **Issue Tracking:**
   - Using GitHub issues to track tasks and features to be implemented in the project.

3. **Branching:**
   - Creating separate branches for different features or tasks to ensure isolated development.
     `git branch branch-name`
   - Leave the main branch by switching to the new branch you have just created.
     `git checkout branch-name`
     Alternatively you can do this in a single step by using the -b flag to tell the git checkout command to create the new branch:
     `git checkout -b branch-name`   

4. **Committing Changes:**
   - Making changes to code files and committing them with descriptive commit messages.

5. **Pushing to Remote:**
   - Pushing your branch's changes to the remote GitHub repository.
     `git push origin branch-name`

6. **Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - Creating pull requests to propose changes to the **main** branch.
   - Reviewing PRs for code quality, correctness, and adherence to coding standards.

7. **Merging PRs:**
   - Merging approved pull requests into the main branch once they have been reviewed and approved.

8. **Handling Merge Conflicts:**
   - Resolving conflicts that occur when multiple branches modify the same code.

9. **Collaboration:**
   - Collaborating with team members by assigning tasks, reviewing code, and ensuring a smooth workflow.

11. **Best Practices:**
    - Following best practices for writing descriptive commit messages, linking commits to related issues, and maintaining a clean Git history.
