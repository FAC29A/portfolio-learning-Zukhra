# Learnings on Automated Testing

## Overview

In weeks 7 to 9 of the learning program, I delved into the crucial aspect of software development - testing. This period focused on understanding how to ensure the correctness of code through the creation of automated tests.

## Topics Covered

### Introduction to Testing

The initial phase provided an introduction to the fundamental concepts of testing in software development. This laid the groundwork for the subsequent workshops.

### Workshops

#### 1. Build a Testing Library

This workshop involved the construction of a testing library. Through hands-on exercises, I gained practical insights into the mechanics of creating a testing framework.

#### 2. Unit Testing Workshop

The unit testing workshop was dedicated to understanding the principles and practices of unit testing. Practical exercises allowed for the application of these concepts to real-world scenarios.

#### 3. Integration Testing Workshop

Integration testing, a critical aspect of ensuring components work together seamlessly, was explored in this workshop. Practical examples provided a deep understanding of integration testing methodologies.

#### 4. TDD Workshop

Test-Driven Development (TDD) was a central theme of this workshop. I learned how to approach development by writing tests before implementing features, enhancing code reliability.
