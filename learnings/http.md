# HTTP Course Learnings

In the HTTP course, I acquired a fundamental understanding of how to work with HTTP requests and asynchronous operations. Below are the key takeaways from the course:

## Asynchronous Execution

I learned how to write code that executes asynchronously, allowing for non-blocking operations. This is essential for web applications to maintain responsiveness while performing tasks that may take some time to complete.

## Callback Functions

I gained the ability to use callback functions effectively to access values that aren't available synchronously. Callbacks are a crucial concept in handling asynchronous code and can be employed to ensure that specific operations occur only after others have finished.

## Promises

I learned how to use promises to manage asynchronous code. Promises provide a structured way to handle operations that may not be available immediately, making the code more readable and maintainable.

## HTTP Requests

Understanding the principles of making HTTP requests and handling responses was a central part of the course. I became proficient in using the `fetch` method to initiate HTTP requests and receive responses from web servers.

## Fetch Options Configuration

I also learned to configure the `options` argument of the `fetch` method for making various types of requests, such as GET and POST. This flexibility allows me to tailor my requests to the specific needs of my web application.

As a practical example, here is code that uses the `fetch` method to make an HTTP request:

```javascript
fetch("https://echo.oliverjam.workers.dev/status/404")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      const error = new Error(response.status);
      throw error;
    }
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```
## Async/Await

Understanding the principles of asynchronous code execution was taken a step further with the introduction of `async` and `await`. I can now use `async` functions to write asynchronous code that reads more like synchronous code, improving code readability.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP Error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log("Data received:", data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  }
}

// Call the async function to fetch data
fetchData();
